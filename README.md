# Automatic Deep Sparse Multi-Trial Vector-based Differential Evolution Clustering with Manifold Learning and Incremental Technique (ADSMTDE)


## Introduction

Here is a novel automatic deep sparse clustering approach based on an evolutionary algorithm (ADSMTDE). Sparse auto-encoder is first applied to extract embedded features. Manifold learning is then adopted to obtain representation and extract the spatial structure of features. Afterward, an evolutionary clustering is performed without prior information  on the number of clusters to find the optimal clustering solution. The proposed approach was evaluated on various datasets, including images and time-series.  This repository contains, the implementation of the developed version of my prevoius algorithm for clustering (IMTDE).
